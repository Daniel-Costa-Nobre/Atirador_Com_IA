# Explanation of the code:
# The objective is making a functional shooting bot;
# The bot tries a random level of shooting, it can be easy or hard;
# Based on how hard the bot get the level, he get more points than in a easier level;
# In all levels if the bot misses, he loses 1 point
# This first push is just for starting setting the reward list, the get_action and set_shooting_level function.
